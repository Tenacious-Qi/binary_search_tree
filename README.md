This was an exercise in data structures and algorithms as part of the The Odin Project. The goal of this assignment was to build a simple binary search tree.

The Tree class includes the build_tree method, which builds a balanced binary tree from a sorted and unique array. 
I found this more challenging than the linked list assignment. One challenge was getting the delete method to work. Getting the recursive version of Tree#level_order to work was also challenging, but I feel more comfortable with recursion after this project.

I used the visualization here to understand what was happening when a node with two children is deleted. https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html
